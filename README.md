Appointment Planner is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, designed to manage contacts and appointments in a simple and intuitive way.

The app allows users to:
	•	Create and view a list of contacts
	•	Create appointments and associate them with a contact
	•	Select date and time through interactive input fields
	•	Navigate between sections without page reloads thanks to React Router

The interface is designed with usability in mind:
	•	Navigation with persistent active state
	•	Reusable and modular components
